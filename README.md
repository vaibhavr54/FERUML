## Project Overview
This project utilizes a machine learning model to recognize facial expressions like happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc. By leveraging face-api.js, the system captures facial landmarks and processes them to classify expressions based on predefined models.

## Features
- Real-time facial expression detection and classification
- Accurate emotion recognition using custom-trained models
- Easy-to-use web interface
- Optimized for performance using face-api.js and lightweight JavaScript

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**
- **face-api.js** (for facial recognition)
- **HTML/CSS** (for front-end design)
- **Machine Learning** (for facial expression classification)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vaibhavr54/Facial-Expression-Recognition.git
   cd Facial-Expression-Recognition
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if using Node.js for package management):
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Additional Setup:**
   - Ensure all libraries like face-api.js are correctly linked in your `index.html`.
   - For Python users, install dependencies with:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Use `poetry install` if you're managing dependencies with Poetry.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to launch the interface.
2. The system will automatically access your camera (ensure permissions are enabled).
3. View your facial expression classification in real-time on the web page.
